## Plugins to assist mocking

- `pytest-mock` for general-purpose mocking

The `mocker` fixture cleans up after itself, so a `with` block must not be used.

https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock/

- `pytest-postgresql`, `pytest-mongo`, `pytest-mysql`, and `pytest-dynamodb` for mocking database access

- `pytest-httpserver` for mocking HTTP servers

- `responses` and `betamax` for mocking requests

- `pytest-rabbitmq`, `pytest-solr`, `pytest-elasticsearch`, `pytest-redis`, and others
