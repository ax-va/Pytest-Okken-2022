## Prioritize features for testing
- *Recent*: New functionality that has been recently repaired, refactored, or modified.
- *Core*: The essential functions that must continue to work in order for the product to be useful.
- *Risk*: Areas of the application that pose more risk, such as areas important to customers but not used regularly by the development team or parts that use third-party code you don't quite trust.
- *Problematic*: Functionality that frequently breaks or often gets defect reports against it.
- *Expertise*: Features or algorithms understood by a limited subset of people.

## On the example of Cards
- Test core features thoroughly.
- Test non-core features with at least one test case.
- Test the CLI in isolation.
