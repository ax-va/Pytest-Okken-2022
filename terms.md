**Change detector tests = tests that break during valid refactoring**

When tests fail whenever the code changes, they are change detector tests.
This problem occurs because mocking tests implementation, but not behavior.

**Happy-path testing = a type of software testing that uses known input and produces an expected output**

**Line coverage = calculated by dividing the total number of lines run divided by the total lines of code**

**Mock = replacing a part of a system with mock objects**

Mock objects are typically intended to be objects that are used in place of the real implementation.
Mock objects are sometimes called test doubles, spies, fakes, or stubs.

**Mock drift = the interface to be mocked changes, while the mock in the test code doesn't.**

**Monkey patch = a technique used to dynamically update the behavior of a piece of code at run-time**
