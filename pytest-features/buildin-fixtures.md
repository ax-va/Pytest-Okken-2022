## `caplog`

similar to capsys and the like; used for messages created with Pythonâ€™s logging system

## `pytestconfig`

used to get access to configuration values, `pluginmanager`, and plugin hooks

## `record_property`, `record_testsuite_property`

Especially useful for adding data to an XML report to be used by continuous integration tools.

## `recwarn`

used to test warning messages

## `request`

used to provide information on the executing test function. 

Most commonly used during fixture parametrization.

## `pytester`, `testdir`

used to provide a temporary test directory to aid in running and testing pytest plugins; `pathlib.Path` for `pytester` and `py.path.local` for `testdir`

## `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`

similar to `tmp_path` and `tmp_path_factory`; used to return a `py.path.local` object instead of a `pathlib.Path` object
