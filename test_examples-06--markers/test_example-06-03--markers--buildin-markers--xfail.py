@pytest.mark.xfail(condition, ..., *, reason, run=True, raises=None, strict=xfail_strict)

Short description:
run=False       don't run
raises          sets an exception type or a tuple of exception types that you want to result in an xfail
strict          should be marked as XPASS (strict=False) or FAIL (strict=True) when passing

Global setting:
xfail_strict=true in pytest.ini

Reasons to mark with xfail:
- Test-driven development for non-implemented behaviors yet but planed to be implemented shortly.
- Remember you if a behavior is fixed with xfail, strict=True.

Result meaning when failing
XFAIL           "You were right, it did fail"

Result meaning when passing
XPASS           "Good news, the test you thought would fail just passed"
FAILED          "You thought it would fail, but it didnâ€™t. You were wrong."
