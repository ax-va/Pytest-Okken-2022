;addopts =
;    --strict-markers ; tells pytest to raise an error if it sees us using an undeclared marker
;    -ra ; tells pytest to list the reason for any test that isnâ€™t passing including "fail", "error", "skip", "xfail", and "xpass"
;xfail_strict = true ; turns any passing tests marked with xfail into failed tests because of wrong understanding of the system behavior
